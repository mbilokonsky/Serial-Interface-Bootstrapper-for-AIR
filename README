This is a bootstrapper for creating projects using Adobe AIR 2.5 or greater. 


What Is It?
This is the source folder for a Flex AIR application. It includes a bootstrapper .mxml file, two custom classes which abstract out some NativeProcess stuff and
a Python script which handles the actual serial interface. Documentation is commented into com.prettysmartstudios.serial.SerialInterface.

Why Use This?
I created this to help me work with Arduino boards on a Mac computer where I was having difficulty with TinkerProxy. This doesn't rely on sockets at all, opting
instead to pass strings around using StandardInput and StandardOutput.
